To make the best use of my themes, they can be utilized to the max as outlined in the description below:

* Agridrive is multi-purpose theme but can be of great use by businesses and companies in the agricultural industries.

* Fctalanta is a multi-purpose theme that can be of great use for football and other sports clubs.

* Musicstudio and Anviltech are also multip-purpose are designed for small business that would like to showcase their merchandise or products. However, please take note that WooCommerce support are yet to be added to these themes.

* FashionHouse, MCGIS and Prodigi are still a work in progress.
